1. Create project
2. Download TestNG and Selenium-java
3. Save java relate value in FrameworkConstants file
4. Save any other input value in properties file
5. AssertJ - kind like TestNG Assertion function but more easy than TestNG. add dependency 
		   -  	<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.assertj/assertj-core -->
				<dependency>
    				<groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
   					<artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
    				<version>3.19.0</version>
   					 <scope>test</scope>
				</dependency>
		   
6. DataProvider - 2D object array is not always the return type of data provider 
	
	object[][] --> first dimension, how many iteration you want to run this test
				   second dimension, how many parameters you want to feed to your test method
				   	
7. Take a screenshot as base64  --> Attach to report (Most recommended way)
		base64 --> encoded string
		
8. Issue in between base64 and Extent reports --> sometimes i can see broken base64 image in Extent report. if open in Eclipse, will be happen this kind issue.
	Copy this report and past it in other place and open with browser.

9. DataProvider use Excel

10. Test execution handling use Excel

11. if we have to click pretty similar object, use Dynamic Locator
